# Nagibator - ESP for Escape from Tarkov
## About
It's a complete code of my cheat, which i called `Nagibator`. Cheat is run using a launcher, which downloads the latest version from a remote server. The subscription system is implemented in the laucher, registration is done with a product key, which is necessary to purchase. During registration, the HWID of the computer is linked to the user's account so that he could not use the same key on multiple computers. Compiled binaries are fully obfuscated and cannot be reversed.

## Why this code is released!?
This is the source code of my project during which I learned how to make cheats for Escape from Tarkov, obfuscate my code to prevent a `reverse engineering` and make an login system with product key. This Way has been hard and thorny, I was banned several times. With the improvement of the anticheat, it finally became worthless, because Internal cheat is quickly detected. So I decided to share this to make it easier to learn cheat making.

The next step is to rewrite the code to an External cheat.

## Cheat Functionnality
It's only ESP, no aimbot.
